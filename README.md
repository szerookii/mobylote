# Mobylote

Mobylote is a mobile application (Android/iOS) that extends the functionality of the Pylote Chrome extension. This app allows users to stay connected, manage their profiles, and stay updated with job postings on the go. The project leverages the [@Gradleless](https://github.com/Gradleless) Pylote API reverse engineering work on [Sylote](https://github.com/Gradleless/sylote).

## Features

- **Regular Connection**: Seamless connection experience, similar to the Pylote Chrome extension.
- **Profile View**: View and edit your profile including name, description, technologies, etc.
- **Availability Update**: Update your availability status.
- **Remaining Availability View**: Check your remaining availability.
- **Job Board**: Browse through job postings.
- **Notifications**: Receive notifications when a new job has been posted.

## Installation

### Android

1. Download the latest APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/szerookii/mobylote/releases) tab.
2. Allow installation from unknown sources on your device:
    - Go to **Settings > Security**.
    - Enable **Unknown Sources**.
3. Install the downloaded APK file.

### iOS

1. Download the latest IPA file from the [Releases](https://github.com/szerookii/mobylote/releases) tab.
2. Since the app cannot be posted publicly on the App Store, you need to sideload it using tools like [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/) or [AltStore](https://altstore.io/). 
3. Alternatively, if your device is jailbroken, you can install it directly.
    - Follow the instructions on the SideStore or AltStore websites to sideload the IPA file.

## Usage

1. **Login**: Use your Pylote credentials to log in.
2. **Profile**: View your profile like name, description, technologies, etc.
3. **Availability**: Update your current availability and view remaining availability.
4. **Job Board**: Browse available job postings and apply directly from the app.
5. **Notifications**: Stay informed with push notifications for new job postings.
